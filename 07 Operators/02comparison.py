# Comparison Operators in Python

# Defining two numbers
x = 5
y = 10

# Performing comparison operations
print(f"{x} > {y}: {x > y}")   # Greater than
print(f"{x} < {y}: {x < y}")   # Less than
print(f"{x} == {y}: {x == y}") # Equal to
print(f"{x} != {y}: {x != y}") # Not equal to
print(f"{x} >= {y}: {x >= y}") # Greater than or equal to
print(f"{x} <= {y}: {x <= y}") # Less than or equal to
