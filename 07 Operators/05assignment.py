# Assignment Operators in Python

# Initializing variable
a = 5
print(f"Initial value: a = {a}")

# Performing assignment operations
a += 2  # Adds 2 to a
print(f"a += 2 → {a}")  

a -= 2  # Subtracts 2 from a
print(f"a -= 2 → {a}")  

a *= 2  # Multiplies a by 2
print(f"a *= 2 → {a}")  

a /= 2  # Divides a by 2 (result as float)
print(f"a /= 2 → {a}")  

a %= 2  # Gets remainder of division by 2
print(f"a %= 2 → {a}")  

b = 10
b //= 3 # Performs floor division by 3 (b = b // 3, result is rounded down)
print(f"b //=  → {b}")  

a **= 2 # Raises a to the power of 2
print(f"a **= 2 → {a}")
